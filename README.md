# React Messenger App

A simple instant messaging app for communicating with your friends.

## Description

A React app built with Redux and a mock api server that generates random data for the client. The frontend app uses Semantic UI for a UI library.

### Disclaimer

> Current implementation does not utilise the development server. This is due to time constraints. All users can run the frontend app independently.

## Setup

1. Install the server with `yarn`.
2. Install the client app with `cd client/` and `yarn`.
3. In root directory, run `yarn dev` for both client and server.

## Scripts

- `serve` is for generating and running the data API.
- `client` is for running the frontend app.
